Figure out how to export to csv from a Database DONE

1. Print/display records from your database/tables - DONE
2. Query for data/results with various parameters/filters - DONE
3. Create a new record - DONE
4. Delete records (soft delete function would be ideal) TO DO
5. Update records - DONE
6. Make use of transactions (commit & rollback) TO DO
7. Generate reports that can be exported (excel or csv format) - DONE
8. One query must perform an aggregation/group-by clause TO DO
9. One query must contain a sub-query TO DO
10. Two queries must involve joins across at least 3 tables - DONE
11. Enforce referential integrality (Constraints) - DONE
12. Include Database Views, Indexes


Stored procedures?? Just have one query be a stored procedure
Indexes - just add on the DB end easily
Transactions???? (Quit and roll back - not sure)
Delete records? Let's just have a delete account option
Add query with aggregation/group-by part
implement isFuture for the initial picks
Put a little more dummy data in to work on front end
Maybe export games too
Need to use more tables!!!! Just a super simple login flow with user settings? And make it say welcome?
Past vs. upcoming picks on picks.cshtml
Add a pickMade column to the the Games model so that we don't show games with picks already

     <div> 
         @if (SignInManager.IsSignedIn(User)) { 
            <div>@UserManager.GetUserName(User)</div> 
            <form method = "post" asp-controller = "Account" aspcontroller = "Logout"> 
               <input type = "submit" value = "Logout"/> 
            </form> 
         } else {  
            <a asp-controller = "Account" asp-action = "Login">Login</a> 
            <a asp-controller = "Account" asp-action = "Register">Register</a> 
         } 
      </div>
